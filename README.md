## Syncthing

The syncthing and syncthing-inotify binaries are included in the app. They are copied to ~/Library/Application Support/SyncthingBar when SyncthingBar is first run. If you want to upgrade syncthing at any time, place the updated binaries in this folder.

By default SyncthingBar will run syncthing and syncthing-inotify when it launches. You can turn this off in Preferences.

## Download

Precompiled binaries are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/nhojb/SyncthingBar/releases) section.
